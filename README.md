# Nonogram

[![demo](http://i.imgur.com/XRs3jk7.gif)](https://Lucas-C.github.io/Nonogram)

This is a fork of the original awesome nonogram (also known as hanjie, picross and griddlers) editor and solver by HandsomeOne.

I only slightly improved the solver algorithm for big grids,
added 3 buttons onto the demo page to load a grid from an image file / save it as PNG / export hints,
and [a gallery](https://Lucas-C.github.io/Nonogram/gallery.html).

For some grids samples, check:
- the [grids/](grids/) directory of this repo
- [Patrick Labatut gallery](http://www.normalesup.org/~labatut/IK3/)
- [nonograms.ru](https://www.nonograms.ru/nonograms/size/small)
